# A little inside look
  be-the-hero is a full-stack application developed for the purpose of supporting local Non Goverment Organizations by allowing 
  users to connect and view notifications about occurrences that may be happening in a nearby institution

## Instructions
  For better project structuring, I decided to make a single repository dividing the back-end and front-end with folders, but 
  in reality it's as if each folder is a little repository
  
## Sidenotes
  Each folder contains a gitignore file and own dependencies that you'll need to install. Don't worry, inside there's also a
  README file which you will find more details about how to install.
